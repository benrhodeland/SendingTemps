# SendingTemps
 Helping climbers understand when conditions are prime

Rock climbing is hard. When a climber takes off on a route (~50-100ft of continuous clinging to a wall), one of the most critical features for success (sending) at all levels of difficulty is the environmental condition. 

The perfect “sending temps” vary by crag, region, and rock type, and most of this knowledge is hard to come by. It’s usually acquired by significant time investment in the way of local experience (20-40 days spent at the crag on weekends over N years), or by meeting just the right old climber who can tell you “Oh you don’t wanna climb hard today, it rained on Tuesday and the wall seeps for 5 days after.”

Sending Temps will take into account recent past regional weather (say 5-10 days before the intended cragging day) to provide a rating for likelihood of success in the coming day or two. It scrapes and incorporates data from MountainProject.com and 8a.nu, two websites used by climbers to ‘tick’ climbs they’ve completed, with dates and difficulties recorded.
