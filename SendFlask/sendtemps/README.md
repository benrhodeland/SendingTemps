# About SendingTemps

SendingTemps is a system for helping outdoor rock climbers understand when conditions are prime.

When you select a point on the map, SendingTemps pulls weather histories for the nearest three crags and provides a prediction for climbing conditions the following day. This is not a forecast, but an incorporation of past events into an inference about the current state of the crag: will that rain 3 days ago have had time to dry up by now?


Rock climbing is hard. When a climber takes off on a route (~50-100ft of continuous clinging to a wall), one of the most critical features for success (sending) at all levels of difficulty is the environmental condition.

Are the rocks dry enough? Does this area tend to stay wet for 3 days after a rain? Has it been warm enough lately to dry out, while still being cool enough to climb hard without sweating too much and slipping off?

## How

Sending Temps takes into account recent past regional weather (say 5-10 days before the intended cragging day) to provide a rating for likelihood of success in the coming day or two. It scrapes and incorporates data from MountainProject.com and 8a.nu, two websites used by climbers to ‘tick’ climbs they’ve completed, with dates and difficulties recorded.

The perfect “sending temps” vary by crag, region, and rock type, and most of this knowledge is hard to come by. It’s usually acquired by significant time investment in the way of local experience (20-40 days spent at the crag on weekends over N years), or by meeting just the right old climber who can tell you “Oh you don’t wanna climb hard today, it rained on Tuesday and the wall seeps for 5 days after.”
